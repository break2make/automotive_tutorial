# Exploring HTTPS With Python

To start with HTTP and HTTPS protocol implementation in python, read this [tutorial](https://realpython.com/python-https/) from RealPython. 

To understand the details about different http(s) clients packages, look into the following resources:
- [5 Best Python Libraries For Working With HTTP](https://www.yeahhub.com/5-best-python-libraries-working-http/)
- [Python and fast HTTP clients](https://julien.danjou.info/python-and-fast-http-clients/)
- [HTTP Requests in Python 3](https://www.twilio.com/blog/2016/12/http-requests-in-python-3.html)



# Useful Python Packages

## Beautiful Soup
Beautiful Soup is a Python library for pulling data out of HTML and XML files. It works with your favorite parser to provide idiomatic ways of navigating, searching, and modifying the parse tree. It commonly saves programmers hours or days of work.

For more details and examples, check [here](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/).

## urllib3
urllib3 is a powerful, sanity-friendly HTTP client for Python. urllib3 brings many critical features that are missing from the Python standard libraries:
- Thread safety.
- Connection pooling.
- Client-side SSL/TLS verification.
- File uploads with multipart encoding.
- Helpers for retrying requests and dealing with HTTP redirects.
- Support for gzip and deflate encoding.
- Proxy support for HTTP and SOCKS.

For more details and examples, check [here](https://urllib3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Requests – HTTP Requests for Humans
Requests allows you to send organic, grass-fed HTTP/1.1 requests, without the need for manual labor. There’s no need to manually add query strings to your URLs, or to form-encode your POST data. Keep-alive and HTTP connection pooling are 100% automatic.
