VS Code is my favourite IDE for development with multiple language like c/c++, python, Go, rust, etc.

# C/C++

## Important extensions
- Microsoft C++ Extension - https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/cpp
- Easy C++ Project - https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ACharLuk.easy-cpp-projects

## Debug
To configure the VS code for C/C++, please check the following link: 
- https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/config-msvc
- https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/cpp-debug

If you have not added a `task.json` configurarion, you first the prepare your code debug-ready:
- Create your c file
- Compile with debug option `-g`
- Run without debug, to check whether it is working properly

If the above steps work properly, the you can place the breakpoint and launch debug.


# Python




# Go




# Rust
