> **Write it three times.**
"Good programmers write software that works. Great ones write software that works exceedingly well. That rarely happens on the first try. The best software usually is written three times:
>1. First, you write the software to prove to yourself (or a client) that the solution is possible. Others may not recognize that this is just a proof-of-concept, but you do.
>2. The second time, you make it work.
>3. The third time, you make it work right." -- https://blog.newrelic.com/engineering/8-ways-become-a-better-coder/

> **Learn techniques, not tools.**
"Programming languages, tools, and methodologies come and go. That’s why it pays to get as much experience as you can with as many languages and frameworks as possible. Focus on the programming fundamentals, because the basics never change; pay more attention to architecture than to programming. If you feel certain that there’s only one right way to do something, it’s probably time for a reality check. Dogma can hamper your ability to learn new things, and make you slow to adapt to change." -- https://blog.newrelic.com/engineering/8-ways-become-a-better-coder/
