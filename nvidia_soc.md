Nvidia Jetson
---

**Nvidia Jetson** a series of embedded computing boards from Nvidia. The Jetson TK1, TX1 and TX2 models all carry a Tegra processor (or SoC) from Nvidia that integrates an ARM architecture central processing unit (CPU). Jetson is a low-power system and is designed for accelerating machine learning applications. A list of Nvidia SoC is:

- Tegra
- Xavier
- Orin
Check [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tegra) for detailed specification of these SoCs.
