# Security

Few interesting articles:
- Hardware and Security: Vulnerabilities and Solutions - https://www2.seas.gwu.edu/~simha/research/HWSecBookChapter12.pdf
  Note: this article discuss about to secure a hardware and hardware for software security

## Threat Analysis

### Book
- Threat Modeling Designing for Security by Adam Shostack. [source](https://moodle.ufsc.br/pluginfile.php/2377555/mod_resource/content/2/Threat%20Modeling.pdf)


## Paper

- TARA+: Controllability-aware Threat Analysis and Risk Assessment for L3 Automated Driving Systems
- An Asset to Security Modeling? Analyzing Stakeholder Collaborations Instead of Threats to Assets
- Threat Modeling for Automotive Security Analysis
- Risk-Oriented Security Engineering (Interesting reading. well-written)
- Combined automotive safety and security pattern engineering approach (Interesting reading)

## Risk Assessment

Detailed listing of various risk analysis technique can be found [here](https://www.nr.no/~abie/RiskAnalysis.htm).

Risk Analysis Steps:
- Rsik Identification
- Risk Evaluation
- Risk Treatment
