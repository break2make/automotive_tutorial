# Exploring Automotive




## Open Source Projects:

### CARLA
Open-source simulator for autonomous driving research [Link](https://carla.org/)

### AirSim

AirSim is a simulator for drones, cars and more, built on Unreal Engine (we now also have an experimental Unity release). It is open-source, cross platform, and supports software-in-the-loop simulation with popular flight controllers such as PX4 & ArduPilot and hardware-in-loop with PX4 for physically and visually realistic simulations.

### Vehicle Simulator

The project and the initial software code have been developed by Elements Design Group of San Francisco and the Jaguar Land Rover Open Software Technology Center in Portland, Oregon. The motivation was to provide an open-source, extensible driving simulator project for the development community. While there are multiple potential uses for the application, the primary goal was to create an application to assist in the development and testing of IVI systems related to driver distraction.
